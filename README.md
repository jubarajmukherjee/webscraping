# Webscraper Flipkart

Overview:
>A basic terminal run code which gets data (Name, Price, Rating) of Laptops from Flipkart website.


What I learnt from it?
>Beautiful Soup is a powerful library used to scrape data easily,
>Pandas module helps to organise the data


Features:
>Just change the url in the code to the desired url on the Flipkart website to get the data of the desired items.
 
Kindly run "pip install bs4/Pandas" in your terminal to install the required packages if they don't exist.
